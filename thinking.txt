  So I guess this can just be a file for messing around with js stuff
  becasue I already have the repo and yadayada

  Cool, I'm glad to be working on this stuff again, not going into too much
  on that front, though.

  What to do with the files upon upload?

  Put all files into a big vat of words...

  Input is an array and I want to put all of those into one long...

  Filter out most common words...

  search for a word: if its in there display the frequency
  show which files have been uploaded, select a file to perform operations on,
  slice out punctuation characters, all lower case it
  sort descending by freq. and be able to choose how many top words,
  filter out transition words

  worry about module refactoring later
}

2.4.2018 {
  All strings to lower case
  Words/characters to remove:
    [" ", "i", "the", "to", "and", "of", "a", "that", "\", ",", "!", "i'm", "just", "what"] +
    ["my", "in", "this", "is", "have", "on", "be", "at", "but"]
}
