  So I guess this can just be a file for messing around with js stuff
  becasue I already have the repo and yadayada
}

2.3.2018 {
  Cool, I'm glad to be working on this stuff again, not going into too much
  on that front, though.

  What to do with the files upon upload?

  Put all files into a big vat of words...

  Input is an array and I want to put all of those into one long...

  Filter out most common words...

  search for a word: if its in there display the frequency
  show which files have been uploaded, select a file to perform operations on,
  slice out punctuation characters, all lower case it
  sort descending by freq. and be able to choose how many top words,
  filter out transition words

  worry about module refactoring later
}

2.4.2018 {
  All strings to lower case
  Words/characters to remove:
    [" ", "i", "the", "to", "and", "of", "a", "that", "\", ",", "!", "i'm", "just", "what"] +
    ["my", "in", "this", "is", "have", "on", "be", "at", "but"]
}

2.5.2018 {
  Work on filtering out the time, word, and rating

  So, I'm getting the wordCounts, the fileNamrArray, and the frequency array,
  but nothing searches each document for a certain thing
    Search for a specific string and return matches...
}

2.7.2018 {
  I'm trying to clean up the tempArray from stuff like "; and /n" and the
  other random strings that get included...

  Fyeah!

  I guess I haven't used the same syntax for everything so this won't be a universal thing?
}

2.8.2018 {
  Click the button to add the text to the screen...?
  What about sending to the front the information about the text?
  That function needs to be worked on a little bit too.

  --- That actually works pretty well right now
}

3.16.2018 {
  Keep working on things.
  The output needs to be adjusted [x]

  Find a way to do analysis on the header word?

}

3.17.2018 {
  Having trouble getting the name from fileArray to output next to
  the timeData output. []

  Right now the submit button populates everything,
  I want to upload files and then choose the ones to analyse []

  I think that using react will be the best way to manage this.
}

3.18.2018 {
  Select .txt files only from input array [x]

  Weird bug where the title isn't above the first entry[x]...

  Choose what else is going to be seen []
    Make it a data visual!
      When am I writing []
      What does the mood look like []
      What words are being captured []

  What will this user interface look like?

  Is the point where I convert over to react now, because that will unlock
  some cool things all around.
}

3.19.2018 {
  search for a word []

}

3.20.2018 {
  get the clicked boxes from the input array [x]
}

3.25.2018 {
  implement sessionStorage instead of react [x]
}

3.27.2018 {
   going with react, BABY [X]
}

4.16.2018 {
  implement search bar [x]
  display intro as daily breakdown []
}

4.17.2018 {
  make a select all button [x]
  average out the rating []
}

<% if (info.length === 3) { %>
